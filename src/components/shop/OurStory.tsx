                LavyaGlow was born from a simple love: for thoughtful gifting, for beautiful corners of the home, and for things that feel personal. What started as a few handmade candles given to friends and family quickly turned into something more when people began asking, "Can I buy one?"
                <br /><br />
                We do the work ourselves â€” each candle is made by us, not resold. Every piece is part of our voice: conceived, crafted, and finished with care from our home in Bangalore.
