          <h2>About LavyaGlow</h2>
          <p>
            LavyaGlow is a Bangalore‑based small business that designs and handcrafts scented candles. We sell directly to customers across India through our web app.
          </p>

          <h2>Handcrafted Products</h2>
          <p>
            All products are handcrafted in small batches. Minor variations in color, texture, or finish are natural and part of the handmade character. Product photos are representative and may vary slightly from the final item delivered.
          </p>

          <h2>Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            By placing an order, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old or have legal parental/guardian consent, and that the information provided is accurate and complete.
          </p>

          <h2>Orders and Acceptance</h2>
          <p>
            An order is confirmed once payment is successfully completed. Order acceptance is subject to product availability and our verification processes. If an item is unavailable after payment, we will contact you with alternatives or issue a full refund.
          </p>

          <h2>Pricing and Taxes</h2>
          <p>
            Prices are listed in INR and include applicable taxes unless stated otherwise. We reserve the right to change prices at any time. The price applicable to your order is the price displayed at checkout at the time of payment.
          </p>

          <h2>Payments (Razorpay Only)</h2>
          <p>
            Payments are processed securely via Razorpay. We do not accept Cash on Delivery (COD). By completing checkout, you authorize Razorpay to process your payment using your selected method (UPI, card, net banking, etc.).
          </p>

          <h2>Dispatch and Delivery</h2>
          <p>
            Orders typically dispatch in 3–4 days. Delivery timelines depend on destination and our trusted partners (DTDC primary, Blue Dart, Porter, Delhivery). Unforeseen delays due to carrier or regional conditions may occur; we share tracking details when available.
          </p>

          <h2>Shipping Damage</h2>
          <p>
            If a product arrives damaged, contact us within 48 hours of delivery with clear photos of the outer packaging, inner packaging, and the damaged item(s). After review, we will offer a replacement or resolution as appropriate.
          </p>

          <h2>Cancellations and Changes</h2>
          <p>
            Once an order is paid, cancellations or changes are not guaranteed, especially after batching or dispatch. Contact us as soon as possible; if feasible, we will try to assist.
          </p>

          <h2>Returns and Refunds</h2>
          <p>
            Due to the nature of handcrafted candles, we generally do not accept returns for opened or used items. For wrong, defective, or damaged items, contact us within 48 hours of delivery for assistance. Approved refunds are issued to the original payment method via Razorpay timelines.
          </p>

          <h2>Bulk and Custom Orders</h2>
          <p>
            For bulk or custom gifting, please reach us on WhatsApp or Instagram. Timelines, pricing, and packaging are confirmed in writing before payment.
